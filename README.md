# Raspberry-Pi-solar-weather-station

# Description
The objective of this project is to build a weather station that could be placed in a remote polar environment and will be able to function for several years without any need for maintenance or data retrieval. The solar panel will charge a series of large car batteries that will be used to power a Raspberry Pi that will retrieve and transmit data collected from various climate sensors.

Calculating how much power will be consumed by our system is a very important task so that we can provide the system with enough power to last through the dark winter of the polar environment. This task consumed most of our time and therefore the following page will outline the power consumption of a Raspberry Pi under different conditions.

# Power Consumption
  ## Methods
  
 *Measuring the instantaneous current that the Raspberry Pi draws was a very difficult task and we started in very basic places and progressively built up our method.*
 
 *  **Filming the DMM** - For our first method we connected two DMMâ€™s to our Raspberry Pi, one in parallel and one in series, to measure the current and watch the voltage. We situated the two instruments next to each other alongside a stopwatch. With this setup we used a smartphone to film these three screens in one frame. We then turned on the power to our Raspberry Pi at the same time that we started the stop watch. After the Raspberry Pi powered up, we transmitted data from the temperature sensors a few times and then proceeded to shut off the Raspberry Pi. 
We were able to analyze this video to get some decent data on the power consumption of the Raspberry Pi by slowing the video down to get the current and voltage as a function of time on the stopwatch. 
* **Watching current on DC function generator** - Due to the lack of sophistication of the previous method, we ran the trial again however this time including the ammeter that is present of our DC function generator to confirm the readings that we were getting.  
* **USB Ammeter** - The last irritation that we used was a USB Ammeter to read our results.
